<!-- Scene I. Nefertyti and her husband, Pharaoh Amenhotep, meet, and he tells her about a revelation he had, a prophetic dream in which Aten, the sun, carried him up to the heavens, from where he overlooked the lands of Kemet, basking in golden sunlight, telling him that Kemet could shake off oppression from the Sea Peoples only through him. The two plan to sway the Kemetian population to worship Aten instead of Amun-Ra as the sole deity of the Kemetian pantheon. -->

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>Queen Nefertyti, the Great Royal Wife of the Pharaoh, stood with her head raised atop the great balcony of the palace at Waset, the Kemetian capital, along the great river Hapi, whose wide waters she overlooked. This great city, the centre of the human world, surpassed all others, from great Hattusa far beyond to Babilim in the lands east.

<!-- Scene II. Amenhotep oversees a religious procession of the peoples worshipping Amun-Ra. The peoples bring him a sacrificial lamb as well as a religious sceptre holding the symbols of all Kemetian gods. As he receives them, Amenhotep announces that Aten is now the sole deity in the universe, and that he will lead the Kemetian peoples on a path to glory. He breaks the scepter in half, taking only the red disc from the top, and places it atop the altar, symbolizing Aten's rule over the other gods, and announces that he shall now be known as pharaoh Akhnaten, and that he will act as prophet for Aten to speak to the people. -->

<!-- Scene III. Akhnaten and Nefertyti sit in the throne room in Amarna, the newly built capital for Kemet, from where they have a view of the great temple of Aten in the city centre. From there, a place more secure than the old capital Men-Nefer, they receive word about the expulsion of diplomats from Atlantis, the home of the Sea People, after Akhnaten announced it was Aten's will that Kemet no longer pays tribute to the Sea Peoples. Religious officials from the lower delta arrive, asking Akhnaten for guidance in following Aten's will, but one of them produces a conceiled Silent Kiss and attacks the Pharaoh, who falls in a coma after being hit by the dart. Nefertyti has the officials executed, but they announce that they represent the people who refuse to support Akhnaten's radical reforms and do not follow his path against the old gods. -->

<!-- Scene IV. Despite the fact that Akhnaten survived the assassination attempt, the people of Lower Kemet revolt against his rule. Nefertyti fears they are supported by the Sea Peoples, and that they must soon abandon Amarna, fleeing further south to the lands where they can muster support for a campaign to recover the kingdom. Nefertyti receives word that their son, Tutankhaten, was captured in a raid on Men-Nefer, and that he is now publicly announcing his support for the rebels, claiming to be the new Pharaoh Tutankhamun. Nefertyti then receives a vision from Aten, who tells her that not all is lost, and that even if she and Akhnaten die, Kemet can still resist eventual dominance from the Sea Peoples if they manage to set aside their internal differences. Aten then commands her to travel south to the valley of Kings, where she shall receive a final vision for enlightenment. -->

<!-- Scene V. Akhnaten awakes, but is greatly weakened from his poisoning, and finds that he is laying near a tomb that is being prepared for him. He prays for Nefertyti, thinking her to be dead, but Aten comes to him in a vision and explains to him that Kemet will not fall, even if the people worship other gods. Aten promises to spare Akhnaten's soul in death, despite his failure, but warns him that since he was too bold in enforcing worship of Aten, the people of Kemet have decided their doom, and a period of harsh punishment by the Sea Peoples is imminent. Nefertyti returns and tells Akhnaten that his tomb is ready, having throught him dead. Akhnaten tells her he is dying, and with his final breath he praises Aten and wishes he had been a wiser Pharaoh in his time. -->
