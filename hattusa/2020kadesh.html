<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '><i>Kadesh, Syria, 1274 BC.</i><br /><br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>Grand Vizier Paser oversaw the slow trickle of men entering the camp, and the soldiers who had arrived earlier, labouring at the pallisades to defend it. The harsh sunlight burned their necks as the men toiled endlessly, digging trenches, building ramps and burying freshly-cut trees from the nearby forests to serve as the pikes atop the dirt walls. Horses, taken free from their numerous chariots, which were collected at the edge of the dugouts, were used as labour animals, dragging around crudely-built sleds to aid them in transporting the fresh lumber over distances. The shadow of a young figure appeared next to his, and the Grand Vizier heard the voice of one of the Pharaoh's sons.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>&#x2015;These horses aren't meant for this kind of labour, the Prince said, they are chariot-carriers, not meaningless oxen used to drag plows. We should let them rest and recover, we might need their strength sooner than we think.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>The Grand Vizier bent his head, and without turning around, replied.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>&#x2015;Your majesty, it is your father's wish to secure this position as soon as possible, he said with a respectful but slow tone. Until he arrives here, alive, strong and healthy, he ordered me to ensure that this shall happen ere the sun sets.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>Paser felt the eyes of prince Khaemweset prying in his neck.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>&#x2015;Let us pray then, he retorted with an icy voice, that he arrives here, alive, strong and healthy, ere you see the error in your ways.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>The young crown prince turned swiftly and stepped back into the royal tent, where he continued in the discussion with the governors of the Nomes bordering the Hatti lands, who had traveled with the royal army into the enemy land. The Grand Vizier looked over his shoulder and sighed. He was thankful for the Pharaoh's trust in him, but he knew that his son had less so. He found it unfortunate that it had to be Khaemweset who traveled with him ahead to secure camp, while the Pharaoh himself oversaw the arrival of the Ra and Ptah divisions, who were approaching from the south. He turned his head slowly to the left, overlooking the trail the vanguard had left as they went ahead of the slower divisions. For a few more minutes Paser tried to entertain himself with watching a group of soldiers struggling to build up a tent, while a gust of wind blew underneath the canvas, whipping it up before they could well secure it. The distraction allowed him to forget about the crown prince for a few moments, before he recalled he had duties himself, and with a disdainful sigh, the Grand Vizier returned to the tent to discuss matters of tactics with the governors.
