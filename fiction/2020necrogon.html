<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>The owner of the small antique shop was unwilling to tell me how he had acquired the <i>Necrogon</i>‒his various mumblings about it were as incoherent as they seemed inconsistent‒but he appeared reluctantly relieved to be able to sell it. He hastily wrapped the red leather tome in some coarse paper after he swept my loose coins I put down as payment on the counter, and while I returned to the front door he stared after me with his suspicious yellow eyes, as if fearing I would change my mind on the spot and demand a refund. The downpour that had chased me into the small backalley shop continued to plummet as I crossed the street back to the bus stop, diving into the vehicle as it arrived.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>Back in my apartment, after hanging my soaked coat by the radiator to dry, I took the package and unwrapped the damp brown sheet to uncover the red leather-bound book. There were no letters on the outside, and the only markings were the faded remants of a symbol etched in the cover. I peered and was barely able to discern the contours of some crude polygons. I weighed the heavy volume in my hand and carefully laid it down on my desk in front of me. For a second I stared at the tome, giving second thoughts to my inexplicable choice to purchase it, and then, with a single finger, I flipped open the cover and unveiled the first of many illegible pages. The alien script was unlike anything I knew, and my eyes went blankly across the dozens of incomprehensible glyphs as I skipped through the endless sheets. The book contained nothing of images, merely the occasional diagram of hexes or other wiccanesque symbols, but nothing seemed familiar to anything I had ever seen before.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>I closed the book and pushed it aside, trying to come up with anything meaningful I could do with it, but after a minute of idle, unresolved pondering I unwittingly opened the book again and reread‒as far as one could consider it "reading"‒the first page.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>I flipped a dozen or so pages and stopped at a page containing a large diagram, covering a good portion of it. Straight black lines went left‒right‒up‒down‒across in seemingly incoherent ways, connecting unknown symbols and words in the same unknown alphabet. Whatever information the author tried to convey here was lost in my inability to comprehend the language.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>My hand slid across the yellow, crispy sheet. The book appeared old yet the ink was still deep black and unfaded. I peererd from a closer distance. The symbols were all formed in a perfectly straight and regular hand, as if it was printed by some ancient Gutenberg machine. I observed the symbols in the diagrams. Some seemed too complicated for old printer typefaces, but too neat to all be made by hand.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>I sighed, closed the book again and tossed it aside. It was probably just some modern print, a facsimile of old stuff. At least I hadn't paid a great price for a merely aesthetic piece of junk. As I sat down on the small couch in the middle of the living room I picked up my phone and started idly browsing the internet, putting the book aside in my mind. Yet for some reason I remained disturbed, being unable to focus on the bits of random information in front of me, and I caught myself thinking about the book again and again. I glanced towards my desk, where the red tome was lying in complete silent innocence.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>I sighed, stood up and investigated the book further. I opened it to search the last page, expecting some company to put a trademark or copyright symbol somewhere in a corner.
