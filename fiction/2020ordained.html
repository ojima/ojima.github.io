<blockquote>&ldquo;Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace. (...) In ancient days, men looked at the starts and saw their heroes in the constellations. In modern times, we do much the same, but our heroes are epic men of flesh and blood.&rdquo;
<div align="right">‒ William Safire, <i>In Event of Moon Disaster</i>, an undelivered speech for Richard Nixon in case the Apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the moon.</div>

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>The unsettling realization of what had happened was incomprehensible to each of the three of us, yet the inconceivable consequences of the events of the past minutes were coming down with each second, silently passing. Each of us stared at some meaningless part of the tiny room were were in, not knowing how to react to it or to each other. The Commander, in the central seat, sat with a grim, focused expression‒immobile apart from an ever so slight twitch in his left eye did he stare out of the module window, into the vast emptiness of space. I do not know how long‒seconds, minutes or hours‒we spent in complete silence, but it was the Module Pilot who finally spoke.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>‒I, he began, with a raspy, trembling voice. I'm sorry.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>That was all he had. That was all any of us had, and all of us knew that.
