<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>It was on what I would have assumed to be a normal Tuesday night, that, as I was one of the last persons preparing to leave the workplace, I stumbled upon something so unreal and unexpected I could not resist noticing, for in a place in the office building I worked at, I came by in the most unusual place, where I had not noticed it before, a door.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>While any sane and reasonable human would not consider that remarkable, the door itself seemed to tell me that there was something odd about it, and I could not lay a finger on why I could not shake off the feeling that that realization was very true. Not only had I never seen that door in that wall before, but it also somehow managed to freeze me in place&#x2014;leaving me with nothing but the inability to move on, standing there, pondering that door. Such mesmerizing, hypnotic effects I have never endured, and for a moment I felt genuine bliss as the door just looked back at me, and I at it. I took a step. It didn't budge nor recoil from my sudden approach. I took the door into me from top to bottom, from the thick wooden texture underneath the solid varnish layer, covering it with no cracks or faults or smudges or dents. It just existed there, in that place.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>For a second I gave the corridor left and right quick glances, but the building was as abandonned as I would have expected, then I turned my attention back to this door, whose existence was all but that. I laid my hand on the tick metal doorknob, feeling the metal below my fingertips. The knob wasn't cold, as if someone had recently held it, ready to unlock it just like me. I felt an unwilling tension in my arms, as my fingers grasped the knob, ready to pull it open, but then something so uncanny happened that I was the first to recoil from this handshake.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>From behind the door, a shierking sound replied to my attempt to twist, and in return my very mind was by this sound twisted. It sounded as if in the room behind someone was being brutally assaulted. A beastly roar, the cry of a cat being skinned alive, nothing compared to this sudden exclamation of terror that sounded from behind that door. My arm jolted in terror and I released the handle of that door, and I knew only for sure that whatever was behind that door, I would rather not know it now, if ever. I picked my bag, and without breaking eye contact, I scuffled backwards through the corridor towards the exit. It wasn't until I put my head on my pillow back at home that I stopped panting.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>The next morning, I went to my supervisor to report on my progress yesterday, and approaching her office, I found myself back in that corridor, where with my very own eyes I could confirm that the door itself was missing.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>&#x2014;Madam, I began as I entered her office. Before I start I must tell you something important.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>My boss looked up from her computer, the screen of which reflected in her glasses.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>&#x2014;Last night, I began with some hesitation. I had a supernatural experience here.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>As expected, she was shocked immediately. Here, she wondered, but from what source? She, like the professional she truly was, went through the necessary steps to ensure that my experience was not a mere play of the mind, and after that she made the call that I had not dared to make myself, but she was consoling in her actions and supported me. The official that they sent to us was less so, and he, with stern eyes, seemed to have little care for the job he was supposed to fulfill.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>&#x2014;No, he reiterated to my boss, I doubt that a full evacuation is necessary. After all, such a minor apparition is nothing more than that&#x2014;an apparition.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>&#x2014;But I saw it, I shouted, pounding the empty wall with my fist, I felt that it was real.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>&#x2014;Many people are confused at these times, he interjected with the same careless monotonous voice, and especially those who are tired, working late&#x2014;it was likely a one-time thing you saw, a trick of your own eyes.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>I felt a warm hand on my shoulder, my boss comforting me, and I took a deep breath as the two of us said goodbye to the government official.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>I got the rest of the day off, courtesy of my boss, who asked me to call her immediately if something else felt wrong, which, despite her insistence, I knew I would never do, considering I found the whole apparition in itself already wrong. On my way out, I passed by the solid wall, which, having overheard what had happened, some of the other office workers walked by in a wide arc. I turned my key in the lock of my appartment, pulling down the cold doorhandle, and went inside, where I went straight back to bed. I woke up a mere hour later when my dear cat climbed up the sheets and purring crawled besides me. I stroke her softly behind her ears as I slowly dowsed back to sleep.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>I did not know what woke me up at first, but a cold breeze from the window I had left open might have triggered it. It was dark, so I must have slept through most of the afternoon and the night, and as I moved to close the window, I saw people down on the street shouting. I glanced at them, and in the dark I thought I saw two men arguing about their cars having bumped into each other, which, not concerning me, I shut out of my life by shutting the glass separating me from the world.<br />

<img width='25' height='1' alt='     '>I turned around only to notice a shocking thing. In the middle of my room, where my bed had stood just moments ago, for I had slept in it, I saw only the rectangular silhouette of the door, looming over me in the darkness.<br />
